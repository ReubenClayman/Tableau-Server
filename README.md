Purpose of the Query
The query is designed to:

Parse complex JSON log data into a structured tabular format for analysis.

Focus specifically on logs related to an "end-bootstrap-session" action.

Extract fields that are likely important for performance analysis, user behavior tracking, or debugging, such as:
- Process ID
- User and session identifiers
- Workbook and sheet identifiers
- Timing and resource utilization metrics (elapsed, ucpu_e, ucpu_i).
  
This approach enables analysts to focus on a subset of the logs for further investigation or reporting.
